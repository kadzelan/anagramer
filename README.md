# Malay Anagramer
Anagramer is a fun and challenging anagram game! Great fun solo, duo or team versus!


## The inspiration
I stumbled upon Countdown gameshow (incidently through 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown) and enjoyed the bits on Youtube since several months ago. I especially enjoyed the humour that Jimmy Carr brought into the gameshow, and though that I could do a web version of my own for the anagram section for Malay (Malaysia) language. 


## Basic functionality
In the Countdown Gameshow, there is a section where teams select up to 9 consonants and vowels, and were given 30 seconds to form the longest word possible from the selected alphabets. 


## How it works
    - The player in turn selects up to 9 consonants and vowels. 
    - The selected letters are placed on the play board in the order they were selected. 
    - once the last letter is selected, all players are given 30 seconds to come up with the longest word in Malay (Malaysia).
    - Points are awarded according to the length of the word (1 letter represents 1 point).
    
## Rules & Parameters
    - For each round: 
        - minimum number of consonants  : 3
        - maximum number of consonants  : 6
        - minimum number of vowels      : 3
        - maximum number of vowels      : 6
    - To earn points:
        - a minimum of 1 letter word to a maximum of 9 letters words are accepted
        - letters cannot be used more than once
    - Exceptions: 
        - Reduplications
            - full reduplication is allowed and awarded points ONLY when the word does not form a plural (kura-kura, langit-langit is allowed; batu-batu, jari-jari is not). Whenever allowed, full duplication words are NOT awarded double points (kura-kura awards 4 points, langit-langit awards 6 points).             
            - partial duplication is allowed and is considered as one word (i.e. dedaun, bebunga, lelangit, jejari etc.) Points are awarded per letter used. 
            - rythmic duplication by altering consonants and/or vowels is allowed as long as the letters used in forming the word is not used more than once.
